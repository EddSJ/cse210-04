# Greed
This is a game where you choose when you are done. Collect as many
gems (stars) as possible to earn points. Watch out for rocks (o),
they will take points away.

## Rules
---
Gems (stars) and rocks (o) will randomly fall from the top of the screen. You, the player (#), can move left or right along the bottom of the screen. If you 'catch' a gem, you earn points. If, however, you 'catch' a rock, you lose points. The game will continue until you close the window.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 rfk 
```
You can also run the program (after following the installation instructions above) from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
```
